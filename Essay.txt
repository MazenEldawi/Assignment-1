1-  a-the difference between forEach and for of that for of work on any iterable while forEach is array method work with array only 
    b- in for of you can control the loop like continue , break and return but forEach don't
     Uses:
     for of: You need to iterate over any non-array iterable 
             you need to exit the loop early using break or continue
     forEach: when you are working with array and you need to perform an operation on every single element
              You don't need to stop or skip iterations based on a condition


2- hoisting mean that the variable declaration move to the top of their scope
    Example: console.log(x); => output is undefined(Because it is not assigned yet )
             var x = 10;
    TDZ: the time between entering scope and being declared (apply with let and const)
     Example: console.log(x); => Error
     let x = 10;


3- == : Compares values only, ignores the data types.
   === : - Compares both value and type


4- try-catch is the way to handle an error , and we use try-catch because the code might fail in runtime 
    try:if the statement in try block execute without error the catch block is skipped
    catch :if an error occurs in try block the execution stops and the control transfer to catch block to handle the error

5- type conversion : you manually convert from one type to another 
                    Example: String(123) => "123"
                            Number("123") => 123
   type coercion : JS automatically converts types when needed 
                    Example: "5" - 2 => 3
                            "10" * "2" => 20 
                            "5" + 2 => 52
